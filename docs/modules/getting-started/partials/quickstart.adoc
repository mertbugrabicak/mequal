The easiest way to get started with Mequal and evaluating SBOMs is to use a readily available container that encapsulates and evaluates the policies, and is able to do an evaluation on any SBOM input provided.

We have a pre-release container always up-to-date with the latest policies we implement. Just run the command below on any SBOM you'd like (supports CycloneDX and SPDX formats) to test it out:

[source,bash]
----
$ cat sbom.json | podman run -i --rm quay.io/pct-security/sbom-check:latest
----

[TIP]
====
As of right now, Mequal is just a set of SBOM manifest policies that are assessed using Conforma/OPA from inside of a container, with future improvements related to our project goals coming soon!
